## My Thoughts about the code

The code in `BookingController.php` and `BookingRepository.php` is good but can be improved for better readability,
maintainability, and error handling. The original code has long methods with complex logic, making it hard to read and
understand. Refactoring into smaller methods improves readability. By extracting logic into smaller methods, the code
becomes easier to maintain and test. Proper exception handling should be implemented to ensure that errors are caught
and handled gracefully. Using the validated method ensures that only validated data is processed, improving security and
data integrity. Using consistent methods to get authenticated users and handle data improves the overall structure and
logic of the code. Additionally, using events and listeners for email dispatching is the best way to handle emails, as
it decouples the email logic from the main application logic and makes the code more modular and maintainable.

## What makes it terrible code

The code in BookingController.php and BookingRepository.php has several issues that make it difficult to work with. The
methods are too long and contain complex logic, making them hard to read and understand. There is a lack of proper error
handling, which can lead to unhandled exceptions and potential application crashes. The code does not use Laravel's Form
Request classes for validation, which can lead to security and data integrity issues. The code is not consistent in how
it retrieves authenticated users and handles data, leading to a disorganized structure. Finally, the email dispatching
logic is tightly coupled with the main application logic, making it harder to maintain and extend.

## Refactoring Laravel Code

The code in `BookingController.php` and `BookingRepository.php` is refactored but can be improved for better
readability, maintainability, and error handling. Here are some thoughts:

1. **Readability:** The original code has long methods with complex logic, making it hard to read and understand.
   Refactoring
   into smaller methods improves readability.

2. **Maintainability:** By extracting logic into smaller methods, the code becomes easier to maintain and test.

3. **Error Handling:** Proper exception handling should be implemented to ensure that errors are caught and handled
   gracefully.

4. **Validation:** Using the validated method ensures that only validated data is processed, improving security and data
   integrity.

5. **Consistency:** Using consistent methods to get authenticated users and handle data improves the overall structure
   and
   logic of the code.

6. **Event Listeners for Email Dispatching:** Using events and listeners for email dispatching decouples the email logic
   from the main application logic, making the code more modular and maintainable.

## How I Would Have Done It

- **Refactor Long Methods:** Break down long methods into smaller, more manageable methods.

- **Use Form Requests:** Utilize Laravel's Form Request classes for validation.

- **Implement Proper Exception Handling:** Ensure that all methods have proper exception handling.

- **Follow PSR Standards:** Ensure that the code follows PSR standards for better readability and consistency.
